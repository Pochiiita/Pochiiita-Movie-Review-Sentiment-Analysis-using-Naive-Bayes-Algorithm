Exploring Inductive and Transductive Learning Approaches with Naive Bayes for Movies Sentiment Analysis

This paper will explore the application of Naive Bayes for movie sentiment analysis with both inductive and transductive learning methodologies to address these
issues. With inductive learning, a fixed dataset is used to train the model, which is then used with unknown data to make predictions. On the other hand, transductive
learning modifies the model according to the particular test data, improving its capacity to handle test data that is out of distribution and imbalanced datasets. This study will
compare the two methods' performance to show their relative efficacy and determine which is best for sentiment analysis jobs.
